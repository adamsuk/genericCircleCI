# genericCircleCI
A repo to store (potentially) useful CircleCI configurations (i.e. ones I'm not using but might one day).

### GCP Bucket & GKE

This example utilises GCPs gcloud and gsutils to copy files to a bucket and 
redeploy a GKE-based deployment.

Notes:
I used this when I was deploying sradams-co-uk-content to GCP during my free account period. Now I'm deploying my Next.js content to Vercel I'm happy to keep that ticking over.
